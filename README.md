# -Modelling-of-Fluidized-Bed-Reactor
Collaborated on a comprehensive study of Fluidized Bed Reactors, focusing on their functionalities and applications in the chemical industry
Analyzed the reactor's mechanism, particularly its role in the Fluid Catalytic Cracking process in petroleum. Explored the dynamics of Bubbling Fluidized Bed Reactors, including gas-solid contacting patterns, using the Kuni-Levenspiel model. The study emphasized phases like Bubble, Cloud, and Emulsion Phases, enhancing understanding of reactor operations in industrial settings.
